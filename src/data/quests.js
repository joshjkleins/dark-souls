After dealing with the spear-wielding Lothric Knight, head all the way down to a room guarded by dogs and Great Axe-wielding Hollows.  Behind some black powder barrels is a semi-hidden staircase where you can find the key to Greirat's cell. From the Tower on the Wall bonfire, head down one floor, and follow the hallway that is inside the tower.  You will eventually run into Greirat's cell. Unlock the cell and speak to Greirat. Accept his help.",
           "Talk to Greirat in Firelink Shrine, and he will speak to you about Loretta. From the Undead Settlement Bonfire (second bonfire after the Vordt of the Boreal Valley boss fight), you will immediately find a building that is dark inside. On the balcony, you will see a a corpse with loot on it.  Attack it to make it fall and you will find Loretta's bone. Give Greirat Loretta's bone.",

If you are having trouble getting Greirat to leave Firelink, try warping to the Dilapitated Bridge bonfire, then cross the bridge and make your way through the ruins to the Road of Sacrifices.",
           "His second scavenging mission becomes available after crossing the bridge between the Catacombs and the Boreal Valley. He will die on this mission, unless one of these conditions matches: Siegward of Catarina is sitting by the kitchen fireplace in Irithyll. Don't talk to Siegward and progress past Pontiff Sulyvahn into the Irythill Dungeon, which will move Siegward to his next area. Or you haven't bought Siegward's armor from Patches and inform Patches of his destination after you send Greirat on his mission. If you already defeated Pontiff Sulyvahn, you won't have the option to tell Patches where Greirat went, so he won't save him. IMPORTANT: You also need to defeat any boss that ISN'T Pontiff (e.g., the Old Demon King) after telling Patches where Greirat went. If this is not done, Patches will NOT leave Firelink despite also not selling you anything (he will just stand there and repeat a single line about Greirat over and over). Defeating Pontiff, in this case, will result in Greirat dying and his body will show up in the sewer area. Note that Greirat will be doomed in these cases: Patches will not rescue Greirat - even if you send Greirat on his second outing after the Yhorm the Giant boss fight, and Siegward has died. If you talked to Siegward in Irithyll: Do not kill Alva the Spurned, who invades when embered — just before the Irithyll Dungeon Bonfire. Do not proceed into Irithyll Dungeon. It has been reported that you may light that bonfire, if perhaps Alva the Spurned has not been killed. Bug/Glitch: Remove Siegward's armor from your inventory before finding Siegward in the well or encountering Patches in the Cathedral. If Patches' spawn at the Cathedral of the Deep or Firelink Shrine are bugged and you can't purchase Siegward's armor: it might be possible to give Siegward the armor that you have. If this succeeds, it has been reported that buying the armor again from Patches might fail the quest. Kill any boss to complete his scavenging mission (Pontiff Sulyvahn is simplest, but the Old Demon King or Champion's Gravetender & Gravetender Greatwolf works too). If you successfully saved him, he'll return safely to Firelink Shrine immediately after killing the boss; otherwise you can find Greirat's Ashes in the sewer area under the kitchen in Irithyll.",
           "Third Outing Tried and Failed: Killed Yoel of Londor upon meeting, Leonhard, Londor Pale Shade invasions, and Yellowfinger Heysel. Waited until after Twin Princes boss fight to send Greirat, still failed. Player Notes: He will request to leave for a third time to Lothric Castle. He will die if he goes; there is no known way to save him. Patches will ask where Greirat went, but this only causes Patches to disappear for a time. Patches will return later and add one Hidden Blessing to his shop inventory, while failing to save Greirat. If you complete Step 5, Greirat's Ashes can be found on the roof at the Grand Archives, after jumping down where you see a group of Corvians. Giving Greirat's Ashes to the Shrine Handmaid will allow her to sell Exploding Bolts, Splintering Bolts, and Lightning Urns along with every other item he used to sell. Additionally, any items which were sold by both NPCs (like Firebombs) are overwritten by Greirat's lower prices (50 souls for a Firebomb, instead of 100). Obtaining Greirat's Ashes through killing Greirat in Firelink Shrine will only unlock the wares that he was selling before he died. Also, if you decide to kill Greirat while both Patches and Greirat are in Firelink Shrine it will turn Patches hostile."
